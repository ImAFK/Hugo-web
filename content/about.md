About me
-----
During my studies, I fell in love with everything related to computer security, from reverse engineering to web security.
Always up to learning new things.

Currently based in Prague, Czech Republic.

### Studies
As of 2020, I have a Bachelor Degree from FIT CTU at Prague and currently working on my Master Degree there.

During my Master Degree studies, I've been studying at NTUST in Taiwan (known as Taiwan Tech).

## Career
### Security Engineer 
Since 2019, I'm employed at NN as a Vulnerability Engineer.
My responsibilities include developing and supporting Vulnerability Management and Scanning, automation and reporting in multiple environments (on-premises, cloud solutions).
Other than that, I'm also supporting the development of TSCM.

### Internship
At the time of studying at NTUST, I was an intern at Advantech in Taipei working as an IoT Developer developing scalable solutions which could be deployed widely in the industry.

## Interests
As mentioned before, I found an interest in Computer Security.
Fields that I'm interested in include Software Defined Radios, Reverse Engineering or Pen-Testing.

In my free time, I love to keep myself in a good shape running, rock climbing or hiking.
As I like to hike high mountains, I'm also taking photographs during my travel and share stories on a blog (Czech only).

If I want to relax, I like to play video games with friends or listen to music.
